syllabus: {
           
           HTML: "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for 
           
           documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
           
           technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages 
           
           such as JavaScript.

           Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage 
           
           and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
           
           of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the 
           
           document.
           
           HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images
           
           and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
           
           HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
           
           for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML 
           
           elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and 
           
           <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and 
           
           provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
           
           Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
           
           HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects 
           
           the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of 
           
           content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
            
           maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational
           
           HTML since 1997.
           
           Development-
    
          In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a 
          
          system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo 
          
          proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the 
          
          browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer
          
          Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally 
          
          adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in 
          
          which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

          The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first 
          
          mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements 
          
          comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these
          
          were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language 
          
          (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.

          HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and 
          
          other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of 
          
          HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by 
          
          the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 
          
          ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early 
          
          text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for 
          
          the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived 
          
          from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of 
          
          generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely 
          
          print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in
          
          this direction with CSS.

          Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet
          
          Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML 
          
          specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly,
          
          which included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar.[9][10] The draft expired after
          
          six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding
          
          in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes.Similarly,
          
          Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested
          
          standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.

          After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 
          
          1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which
          
          future implementations should be based.

          Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the 
          
          HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide 
          
          Web Consortium (W3C). However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000).
          
          HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began 
          
          on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable 
          
          with the W3C in 2008, and completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.",
          
          css: "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
          
          document written in a markup language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
          
          alongside HTML and JavaScript.

          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.his 
          
          separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of 
          
          presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS 
          
          in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
          
          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
          
          styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser 
            
          or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if 
          
          the content is accessed on a mobile device.
          
          The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
          
          than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
          
          The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME 
            
          type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS 
          
          validation service for CSS documents.
          
          In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and 
          
          XUL.
          
          History- CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.[21] At the time, Lie was working 
          
          with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the
          
          same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the 
          
          first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[23] being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was 
          
          influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.

          Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup 
           
          Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.One requirement for 
          
          a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing
          
          style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be 
          
          influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.
          
          As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web 
          
          developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex
          
          HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[26] made consistent site 
          
          appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor 
          
          developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could
          
          therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[27] Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the 
          
          structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for 
          
          printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.
          
          Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine
          
          different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list.[25] Of these nine proposals, 
          
          wo were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets[21] and Stream-based Style
          
          Sheet Proposal (SSP).[24][28] Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with 
          
          Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.[29][30][31] Bert Bos implemented his own SSP
          
          proposal in the Argo browser.[24] Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard 
          
          (the 'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup 
          
          languages besides HTML).
          
          Lie's proposal was presented at the "Mosaic and the Web" conference (later called WWW2) in Chicago, 
          
          Illinois in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995.[22] Around this time the W3C was already being 
          
          established, and took an interest in the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end 
          
          chaired by Steven Pemberton. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML 
          
          editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project,
          
          with additional members, including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft, participating as well. In August 1996, 
          
          Netscape Communication Corporation presented an alternative style sheet language called JavaScript Style 
          
          Sheets (JSSS).[22] The spec was never finished, and is deprecated.[32] By the end of 1996, CSS was ready 
          
          to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.
          
          Development of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review 
          
          Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working groups: HTML Working group, chaired by
          
          Dan Connolly of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad; and CSS Working group, 
          
          chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C.
          
          The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in
          
          the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998.
          
          SS level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.
          
          In 2005, the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This meant
          
          that already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors, and CSS 3 Text were pulled back from 
          
          Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level.",

          JS: "JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language
          
          that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
          
          prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

          Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript
          
          enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
          
          use it,[10] and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
          
          As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including 
            
          object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays,
            
         dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as
            
         networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded
         
         to provide these features.
          
         Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other
         
         types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such 
         
         as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for 
         
         writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
          
         The terms Vanilla JavaScript and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not extended by any frameworks or 
         
         additional libraries. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.
          
         Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and 
         
         respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. JavaScript
         
         was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[13] The JSON serialization format, used 
         
         to store data structures in files or transmit them across networks, is based on JavaScript.
         
         Development-JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages on the Web. However, many
         
         professional programmers initially denigrated the language due to the perceived target audience of Web 
         
         authors and other such "amateurs". The advent of Ajax returned JavaScript to the spotlight and brought
         
         more professional programming attention. The result was a proliferation of comprehensive frameworks and 
         
         libraries, improved JavaScript programming practices, and increased usage of JavaScript outside Web 
         
         browsers, as seen by the proliferation of Server-side JavaScript platforms.

         In January 2009, the CommonJS project was founded with the goal of specifying a common standard library 
         
         mainly for JavaScript development outside the browser.
         
         With the rise of single-page applications and JavaScript-heavy sites, it is increasingly being used as a
         
         compile target for source-to-source compilers from both dynamic languages and static languages.",

         react: "React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces.
         
         It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

         React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal 
         
         for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. However, fetching data is only the beginning
         
        of what happens on a web page, which is why complex React applications usually require the use of additional
        
        libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API.
        
        History-React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype
        
        of React called "FaxJS".[9][10] He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP.[11] It was 
        
        first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012.[12] It was open-sourced at
        
        JSConf US in May 2013.

        React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's
        
        React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.
        
        On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new core algorithm of React framework library for
        
        building user interfaces.[13] React Fiber was to become the foundation of any future improvements and
        
        feature development of the React framework.
        
        On April 19, 2017, React 360 V1.0.0 was released to the public.This allowed developers with React 
        
        experience to jump into virtual reality development.
        
        On September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the public.
        
        On February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the public.The release introduced React Hooks.",

    phython: "Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van
    
    Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable 
    
    use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers 
    
    write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

    Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
    
    procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included"
    
    language due to its comprehensive standard library.
    
    Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released 2000, introduced
    
    features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python
    
    3.0, released 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much
    
    Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Due to concern about the amount of code written for Python 2,
    
    support for Python 2.7 (the last release in the 2.x series) was extended to 2020. Language developer Guido van 
    
    Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project until July 2018 but now shares his leadership as a member
    
    of a five-person steering council.
    
    Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and
    
    maintains CPython, an open source[32] reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software
    
    Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.
    
    History-Python was conceived in the late 1980s[33] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)
    
    in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL),[34] capable of exception 
    
    handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[8] Its implementation began in December 1989. Van 
    
    Rossum continued as Python's lead developer until July 12, 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" 
    
    from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon
    
    him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[36] In January, 2019, active 
    
    Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a 
    
    five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.

    Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage
    
    collector and support for Unicode.
    
    Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely 
    
    backward-compatible.[39] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[40] and 2.7.x version 
    
    series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation 
    
    of Python 2 code to Python 3.
    
    Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large 
    
    body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[42][43] In January 2017, Google announced
    
    work on a Python 2.7 to Go transcompiler to improve performance under concurrent workloads."
